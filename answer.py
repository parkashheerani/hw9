Questons 2:
========================================================================================================
Given two strings s and t, determine whether they are isomorphic.
If the characters in s can be replaced according to some mapping relationship to get t, then the two strings are isomorphic.
Each occurrence of a character should map to another character without changing the order of the characters. 
Different characters cannot be mapped to the same character, the same character can only be mapped to the same character, and a character can be mapped to itself.
Example 1:
========================================
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:
========================================
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:
========================================
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
"""
def isIsomorphic(s, t):
    #write your code here, return True or False

Questons 3:
========================================================================================================
Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value.
Return the largest lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.
Example 1:
========================================
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation:The only lucky number in the array is 2 , because the value 2 occurs 2 times as well.
Example 2:
========================================
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:1, 2, and 3 are all lucky numbers, and only the largest 3 among them needs to be returned.
Example 3:
========================================
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:There are no lucky numbers in the array.
Example 4:
========================================
Input: arr = [5]
Output: -1
Example 5:
========================================
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 7

Questons 4:
========================================================================================================
Given an integer array nums, please return the number of numbers whose median is even.
Example 1:
========================================
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 3
Explanation:
12 is 2 digits (even number of digits)
345 is 3 digits (odd number of digits)
2 is 1 digit (odd number of digits)
6 is 1 digit (the number of digits is odd)
7896 is 4 digits (even number of digits)
So only 12 and 7896 are numbers with an even number of digits
Example 2:
========================================
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1
Explanation:Only 1771 is a number with an even number of digits.
Example 3:
========================================
Input: nums = [5464,545,12131,15454,112,1,65,457]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Only 5464 and 65 are numbers with an even number of digits.
